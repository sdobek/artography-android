artography-android
==================

the android app that shows you street art in your area


Problem statement: People that appreciate street art need a way to connect with their community’s art, based on location and newness of the piece. There is currently no very good way to do this.

Solution: “Artography” is like a yelp for street art. You can explore the street art around you, see details about the artist/artists piece, and add new art sites that you discover. 

Basic User Story:
- User creates new account and logs in.  The account is made through ParseUser. 
- For the home screen they see a feed of recently added street art styled like in the airbnb app.
- They click on a tab which takes them to a map. This map will display art in their current vicinity in a yelp like fashion.
- A picture can be clicked in either the list or map view, where they can see the detailed view of the art piece.  The piece can be editted or shared from this view.
- If the user finds a previously undocumented piece of art, they can take a photo of it with the app and upload for others to see.
- Each piece of art can be favorited or flagged for inappropriateness.  Flaggin a picture hides it while it is reviewed.

------------------------------------------------(Future Verisons)------------------------------------------------

- mark recent pieces of art with a special "fresh" marker.

- Each piece of art could be "checked into."

- Create and explore art trails: Users can select a trail of checkpoints and check off or check-in to art sites as they visit them. They get a badge when they finish a full trail.

- If there is extra time they could filter art by "tags" or "categories" in a search.

- Create a favorite view to view only pieces the user has favorited.

- Potential verification for the actual artist who made the piece to comment on it. 

- Users can report if a piece of art has been removed at which point we can archive it.
